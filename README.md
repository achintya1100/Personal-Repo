# Sentence Parser

Hey everyone! This is my sentence parser, programmed in ProLog, a programming language utilizing logic.
This program is able to break a sentence into its constituent parts of speech, such as determiner-noun, prepositional, verb-phrase, and noun-phrase agreements.
The output of the program is a tree-like structure that illustrates the relationship between words in the sentence.
